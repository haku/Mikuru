Mikuru is an Android rsync app.

WARNING:
This is ALPHA software (that is even less stable than BETA).
Use at your own risk.

To complete this source you will need to run fetchbin.sh to get the
pre-built rsync binary.

At the moment config is read from a text file '/sdcard/mikuru.conf'.
The first line contains the rsync password.
All following lines are individual arguments for rsync.
This will be improved when I have time to write a nice GUI.

WARNING: 
May contain excessive desu.
