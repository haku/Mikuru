Mikuru is an Android rsync app.

To complete this source you will need to run fetchbin.sh to get the
pre-build rsync binary.

At the moment config is read from a text file '/sdcard/mikuru.conf'.
The first line contains the rsync password.
All following lines are individual arguments for rsync.
This will be improved when I have time to write a nice GUI.
